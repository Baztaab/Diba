# Project Memory

This folder is the single source of truth for cross-chat continuity.

## Files

- `CURRENT_STATUS.md`: Snapshot of where the project stands now.
- `NEXT_STEPS.md`: Prioritized next actions.
- `WORKLOG.md`: Chronological activity log.
- `POLICIES.md`: Execution policies and coding standards.
- `adr/`: Architectural Decision Records.

## Update Rule

After each meaningful change:

1. Add one entry to `WORKLOG.md`.
2. Update `CURRENT_STATUS.md` if project state changed.
3. Update `NEXT_STEPS.md` if priorities changed.
4. Add or revise ADRs under `adr/` when decisions are made.
